# overview
In automobile manufacturing, a PPE kit is essential to protect workers from risks like chemical exposure, sharp objects, heavy machinery, and high noise levels. Key components include helmets, safety goggles, gloves, masks, ear protection, steel-toed boots, and flame-resistant clothing. PPE ensures worker safety, prevents accidents, and maintains compliance with health and safety standards.
# Data set
A dataset is a structured collection of data used for analysis, research, or machine learning. It typically consists of rows (observations or records) and columns (features or variables) organized in a tabular format. Datasets can come from various sources, such as surveys, sensors, databases, or simulations.

Key Types:

1. Structured Dataset: Organized data (e.g., spreadsheets, SQL databases).


2. Unstructured Dataset: Free-form data (e.g., text, images, videos).


3. Time-Series Dataset: Data collected over time intervals (e.g., stock prices).


4. Open or Proprietary: Publicly available or restricted access datasets.



In brief, datasets are the foundation for data analysis, training AI models, and driving decision-making processes.
